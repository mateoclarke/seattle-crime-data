# Socrata - 24 Hour Coding Challenge

This project is a 24 hour coding challenge playing with the City of Seattle Crime Dataset via the Socrata SODA API. 

I am using:
- Sass/Compass (for better stylesheets)
- Gulp (for workflow mgmt)
- NPM (for node module installation)
- Leaflet & Mapbox (for Mapping & Tiles)
